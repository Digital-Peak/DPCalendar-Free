I WANT TO TEST TRASHING A CATEGORY IN /ADMINISTRATOR/

I am "Administrator"
I do administrator login ""
I am going to "Navigate to Categories page in /administrator/"
I am on page "administrator/index.php?option=com_categories&extension=com_weblinks"
I wait for text "Weblinks: Categories"," '60"," ['css' => 'h1']"
I set filter "Select Status"," 'Archived"
I search for item "$this->categoryTitle"
I check all results ""
I am going to "try to delete a Weblinks Category"
I click toolbar button "Trash"
I wait for element "['id' => 'system-message-container']"," '60"
I expect to "see a success message after Trashing the category"
I see "1 category successfully trashed."," ['id' => 'system-message-container']"
